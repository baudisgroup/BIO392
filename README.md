## Schedule

The course schedule consists of 1 afternoon (Tuesday) and 3 "full" days (Wednesday - Friday) in the first two weeks, with 1.5 days in the last week.

The "full days" run from 09:00 - 17:00, with a break from 12:00 - 13:30. 

Conceptually, mornings are predominantly related to introductions, presentations and discussion of the previous days, and are afternoons reserved for independent  work on the examples and tasks.

Directories:


File and directory paths in UNIX use the forward slash "/" 
to separate directory names in a path.

examples:

/              "root" directory
/usr           directory usr (sub-directory of / "root" directory)
/usr/foo       foo is a subdirectory of /usr

Moving around the file system:


pwd               Show the "present working directory", or current directory.
cd                Change current directory to your HOME directory.
cd /usr/foo       Change current directory to /usr/foo.


Listing directory contents:


ls    list a directory
ls -l    list a directory in long ( detailed ) format

   for example:
$ ls -l 
drwxr-xr-x    4 cliff    user        1024 Jun 18 09:40 WAITRON_EARNINGS
-rw-r--r--    1 cliff    user      767392 Jun  6 14:28 scanlib.tar.gz
^ ^  ^  ^     ^   ^       ^           ^      ^    ^      ^
| |  |  |     |   |       |           |      |    |      |  
| |  |  |     | owner   group       size   date  time    name 
| |  |  |     number of links to file or directory contents
| |  |  permissions for world
| |  permissions for members of group
| permissions for owner of file: r = read, w = write, x = execute -=no permission
type of file: - = normal file, d=directory, l = symbolic link, and others...

ls -a        List the current directory including hidden files. Hidden files start 
             with "." 
ls -ld *     List all the file and directory names in the current directory using 
             long format. Without the "d" option, ls would list the contents 
             of any sub-directory of the current. With the "d" option, ls 
             just lists them like regular files. 
             


Moving, renaming, and copying files:


cp file1 file2          copy a file
mv file1 newname        move or rename a file
mv file1 ~/AAA/         move file1 into sub-directory AAA in your home directory.
rm file1 [file2 ...]    remove or delete a file
rm -r dir1 [dir2...]    recursivly remove a directory and its contents BE CAREFUL!
mkdir dir1 [dir2...]    create directories
mkdir -p dirpath        create the directory dirpath, including all implied directories in the path.
rmdir dir1 [dir2...]    remove an empty directory


Viewing and editing files:


cat filename      Dump a file to the screen in ascii. 
more filename     Progressively dump a file to the screen: ENTER = one line down 
                  SPACEBAR = page down  q=quit
less filename     Like more, but you can use Page-Up too. Not on all systems. 
vi filename       Edit a file using the vi editor. All UNIX systems will have vi in some form. 
head filename     Show the first few lines of a file.
head -n  filename Show the first n lines of a file.
tail filename     Show the last few lines of a file.
tail -n filename  Show the last n lines of a file.

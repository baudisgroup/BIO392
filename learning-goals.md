# Learning Goals

This page list the "core learning goals" in preparation for the exam at the end of the course. These my not cover 100% of possible questions, but rather be considered representative.

### General computing questions

There can be some non-technical questions on e.g. best software practices (OpenSource vs. "black box" software, choice of operating system...). Here, it may be more about justifying an opinion vs. providing a "true answer".


### File types in genomics and their use

You should be able to list at least 2-3 core features (main use cases, type, core strength, core weakness).

- FASTA
- FASTQ
- SAM/BAM/CRAM
- BED
- VCF (more extensive understanding of file structure expected)
- "segment files"

### General vocabulary & topics

- What are "genome reference assemblies", and can you name (some of) them?
- Structuring of HGVS annotations (and - possibly made up - example)
- Basic understanding of cytogenetic banding annotation, and (approximate) spatial resolution of such annotations

### Standard procedures & their application

- What is "liftover" being used for?
